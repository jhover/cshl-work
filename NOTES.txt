This is a naive, possibly resource-intensive stab at creating a simple CAFA processing pipeline. First step 
is to get sequence similarity and use that to extend existing GO annotations to
most similar un-annotated proteins.

Second step will be to integrate additional data sources (e.g. Protein-Protein interaction data, gene 
expression data). 


PIPELINE:

Split FASTA files
 ~/git/cshl-work/cafa4/fastasplit.py -n 999999 -v -w ./uniprot /data/hover/uniprot/uniprot_sprot.fasta

time:  ~ 15 minutes

time find -L uniprot | grep / > uniprotlist.txt
45 seconds


Run pairwise needle comparison. 
rugen has 32 cores. use 16. 
time ~/git/cshl-work/cafa4/pairwise.py -v -t 16 -w ./seqout -L uniprotlist.txt 


ISSUES:  uniprot ~560k proteins -> files, issues with ls, command line argument list.
